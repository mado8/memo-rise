## Description

A memory application to help users dedicate things to their long-term memory.

Is it really possible to improve your long-term memory? The answer is Yes! You can! There are a lot of studies that show that to improve your memory, repetition is the most successful method. 	
Memory does not fade over time, once information has been acquired it stays stored. What fades is the ability to access memory. Our application is resolving the ability to access memory that we want to retrieve.
